this is a simple little phone to use , but the breakage is unacceptible . -0.12246444821357727
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand , for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser - known cast and for the super - intelligent script that does not insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism . 0.07195350527763367

the directing and the cinematography are not quite as good . 0.39757758378982544

the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland . -0.761743426322937

the dialogue sucked . -0.8172252774238586
